# CASA_Handin
 
My handin  for the context-aware security analytics course at unisa in Salerno.
The model of the 2d Pose estimation, as well as all the images are not included in the github, as it exceeds the size of the repository.
However all joint data text files are included. 

I have split the Notebook in 2 because it got too long, so its one for extracting the frames and one for preprocessing and NN training.
They are called (Part1_Obtaining_Joint_Data and Part2_Prep_and_NN.ipynb) 

The Paper is also in the Repository.


Have a nice day!
