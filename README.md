My handin  for the context-aware security analytics course at unisa in Salerno.
The included OpenPose model and the dataset are not included.

You can find them here:

Gotcha Dataset

I have split the Notebook , one part for extracting the frames and one for preprocessing and training.
They are called (Part1_Obtaining_Joint_Data and Part2_Prep_and_NN.ipynb) 

The Paper is also in the Repository.
Have a nice day!
