The model of the 2d Pose estimation, as well as all the images are not included in the github, as it exceeds the size of the repository.
However all joint data text files are included. I have split the Notebook in 2 because it got too long, so its one for extracting the frames and one for preprocessing and NN training.

The Paper is also in the Repository, and here is a link to a drive folder where everything is uploaded for backup.

Have a nice day!
